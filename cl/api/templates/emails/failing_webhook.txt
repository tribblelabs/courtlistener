Hello {{ first_name }},

Hello,
{% endif %}

{% if disabled %}
After eight failed attempts over the last two days, one of your webhooks has been disabled and will no longer receive events.
{% else %}
We couldn't deliver events to one of your webhooks. If this problem persists for approximately 48 hours, this webhook will be disabled until it is fixed on your server.
{% endif %}

Please find more details below:
Webhook Type: {{ webhook.get_event_type_display }}
Webhook Endpoint: {{ webhook.url }}
Webhook Event Failure Count: {{ failure_counter }}
Webhook Event Details: https://www.courtlistener.com{% url 'view_webhook_logs_detail' webhook_event_pk %}

{% if disabled %}
To re-enable this webhook, review your logs in the webhook settings to see the responses we are getting from your server. Once your server is fixed, you can re-enable the webhook in your settings:
https://www.courtlistener.com{% url 'view_webhooks' %}
{% else %}
We'll continue trying to deliver events to this webhook up to eight times before disabling further events.
{% endif %}

Thank you for looking into this.
